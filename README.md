# Gameboy emulator in C# (WIP)

Project is still a work in progress. CPU opcode implementation was inspired by https://github.com/Washi1337/Emux .

## Current status of project
OpCodes have all been implemented. Next steps: implement unit tests for all ALU functions. Implement unit tests to verify that each opcode does what it should do.
